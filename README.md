## Description:

This is a technical test for AdSecure. The test consists of 4 exercises. In the first 3 you have to create an optimized algorithm following the statement.
The last one is called contributors-list-app, I developed it using Angular and the main goal is to get a github repository contributors list using their API. 

## Instructions:

### Running:
* Run highest-occurrence function
        From this directory: npm run highest-occurrence
    * Run Maximum Sub Array Sum function
        From this directory: npm run max-sub-array-sum
    * Run highest-occurrence function
        From this directory: npm run average-pair
    * Run the contributors app:
        From this directory: cd contributors-list-app; npm start; 
	Open the browser at localhost:4200

### Testing
* Run highest-occurrence test
        From this directory: npm run test-occurrence
    * Run Maximum Sub Array Sum test
        From this directory: npm run test-max-sum
    * Run highest-occurrence test
        From this directory: npm run test-average-pair
    * Run the contributors app:
        Service tests can be identified as service.spec.ts.
